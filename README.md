# Histabot0.2
Histabot

This is the readme file for https://github.com/Histabot where Histabot0.2 development artifacts reside. It was created as a prototype of a google based chatbot to teach history to kids using five famle ad male historical figues. It impersonates these historical figures and changes its voice and content as if the historical figure was in the room having a conversation with the children.

This histabot is developed with Dialogflow and hosted on "Actions-on-Google". Anybody can trigger it using the phrase "talk to my famous Heroes".

The user ID for Dialogflow, Google and Gitbub is histabot0.2@gmail.com. Please contact mian.ahmad@gatech.edu or dgonzalez42@gatech.edu for access them if you like.

You can create your own version by creating a new empty agent in DialogFlow and following standard import/restore from zip function.
